This program was created as part of a project for CSE 464 - Algorithms. It uses
a Sobel Matrix to dynamically and recursively track relative gradient energy in an 
image, then resizes that image according to the least energy difference in the 
removal of a top to bottom pixel seam. For a better understanding of how the image
works, take a look at the images that have been uploaded as part of the project.
